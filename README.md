**How to Use:**

Add a new feed: *Call the add_feed() function with the category, name, and sources (a list of exchanges and symbols).*

Update an existing feed: *Use the update_feed() function to modify an existing feed's sources or category.*

Delete a feed: *Use the delete_feed() function to remove a feed by name.*

Once you've run the script, the changes will be saved into a new JSON file (feeds_updated.json).
